Stratify – Technical Experience Flow

    Game Launch Detection
    Stratify is a background Overwolf application that listens for the launch of Valorant using Overwolf’s game detection services. Once the game is active, it begins subscribing to relevant game event streams.

    Match Information Retrieval
    Through Overwolf’s Game Event Provider (GEP), Stratify accesses the match_info and me features. This provides:

        The current map (e.g., Haven, Bind)

        The local player’s selected agent

        A full list of allied agents through the match roster

    No opponent data is accessed at any time.

    Buy Phase Trigger
    Stratify listens for the round_phase event to identify the beginning of each round’s buy phase. This is the moment during which strategy decisions are most relevant and time-sensitive.

    Strategy Selection Engine
    Upon detecting the buy phase, Stratify uses locally stored data models (agent abilities and tags) to analyze the team’s collective capability. It then selects a matching strategy from a predefined library of site- and map-specific strategies.

    Task Assignment and Display
    Once a strategy is selected, Stratify assigns individual tasks to agents based on their ability tags. These assignments are presented to the user in a lightweight in-game overlay. Tasks include statements such as:

        “Omen: Smoke CT and Garage”

        “Breach: Flash close cubby”

        “Jett: Entry through C Long”

    These instructions are passive, text-based, and do not control gameplay or input.

    Player Execution
    The user can act on the suggestions or ignore them entirely. The app is non-intrusive and designed to aid communication and decision-making, particularly in ranked matches without a designated shotcaller.

Compliance and Safety Considerations

    All data is collected via Overwolf’s approved game integration, not directly from Riot’s APIs.

    No opponent or external account information is accessed or stored.

    The app does not automate gameplay, provide predictive analytics, or use machine learning models.

    Strategy data is predefined and does not adapt in real-time based on opponent behavior or performance.

Purpose

Stratify is built to improve the quality of team coordination and in-game decision-making in solo queue and uncoordinated team environments. It is not a competitive exploit, but a guidance tool that operates entirely within the game’s intended mechanics and Riot’s developer guidelines.
