# Stratify

**Stratify** is an IGL (In-Game Leader) tool designed to help ranked players and teams make better round-by-round decisions in real time. Built on the Overwolf platform and powered by their GEP (Game Events Provider), the app automatically analyzes your team composition and the current map to suggest tailored strategies during the buy phase.

---

## What It Does

- Detects your full **team composition** (agents selected)
- Recognizes the **current map and round phase**
- Suggests a **pre-modeled strategy** that fits your team’s unique ability set
- Assigns **individual tasks** to agents (e.g. "Omen: smoke CT", "Breach: flash site")
- All recommendations are displayed **before the round starts**

This tool is built to assist players who don’t always have a designated play caller or coordinated voice comms, by offering smart and easy-to-follow team strategies during the most critical phase of the round: the buy phase.

## Safety & Riot Compliance

Stratify is built with **fair play** and **player safety** as core priorities:

-  **No opponent data is accessed or used** — strategies are based solely on your own team composition and the current map.
-  Uses only **official APIs** provided by Overwolf and Riot Games.
-  Does **not automate gameplay**, aim, input, or provide any competitive advantage beyond what a human IGL could offer.
-  All logic is pre-modeled — this is **not machine learning**, **not predictive**, and **not exploitative**.

---

##  Privacy and Security

- The app runs entirely on the player's machine and does **not send or store personal data** externally.
- No login or account linking is required.
- All agent data and strategy logic are securely stored and only used in-session.

##  Current Status

This app is currently in **active development**. A public beta release is expected soon.
