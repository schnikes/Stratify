# Stratify

**Stratify** is an in-game IGL (In-Game Leader) tool designed to help solo queue and coordinated teams make better round-by-round decisions in real time. Built on the Overwolf platform and powered by Riot’s public in-game data, the app automatically analyzes your team composition and the current map to suggest tailored strategies during the buy phase.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- Detects your full **team composition** (agents selected)
- Recognizes the **current map and round phase**
- Suggests a **pre-modeled strategy** that fits your team’s unique ability set
- Assigns **individual tasks** to agents (e.g. "Omen: smoke CT", "Breach: flash site")
- All recommendations are displayed **before the round starts**

This tool is built to assist players who don’t always have a designated play caller or coordinated voice comms, by offering smart and easy-to-follow team strategies during the most critical phase of the round: the buy phase.

## ✅ Safety & Riot Compliance

Stratify is built with **fair play** and **player safety** as core priorities:

- ✅ **No opponent data is accessed or used** — strategies are based solely on your own team composition and the current map.
- ✅ Uses only **official APIs** provided by Overwolf and Riot Games.
- ✅ Does **not automate gameplay**, aim, input, or provide any competitive advantage beyond what a human IGL could offer.
- ✅ All logic is pre-modeled — this is **not machine learning**, **not predictive**, and **not exploitative**.

---

## 🔒 Privacy and Security

- The app runs entirely on the player's machine and does **not send or store personal data** externally.
- No login or account linking is required.
- All agent data and strategy logic are securely stored and only used in-session.

## 🚧 Current Status

This app is currently in **active development** and available to test in the Overwolf Developer Console. A public beta release is expected soon.
